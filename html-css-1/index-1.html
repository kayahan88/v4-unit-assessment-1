            <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting 
                content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that
                 is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is 
                 known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major
                browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application
                Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
            </p>

            <div class=separator></div>
            <p>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major 
                update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the 
                language with support for the lastest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language 
                both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as 
                web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's ridigity; and to remain backward-compatible 
                with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM 
                Level 2 HTML.

            <h2>About CSS3</h2>

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
                document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide 
                Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <div class=separator></div>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and 
                fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in 
                specification of presentation characteristic, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying 
                the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. 
                Separation of formatting and methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen 
                reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content 
                is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine 
                which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority 
                scheme is predictable.

            <div class=separator></div>
            <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) 
                text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation 
                service for CSS documents. In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including 
                XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
